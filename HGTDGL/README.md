# Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)

[Alternative PyTorch-Geometric implementation](https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT)

Heterogeneous Graph Transformer is a graph neural network architecture that can deal with large-scale heterogeneous and dynamic graphs.

You can see our WWW 2020 paper [“**Heterogeneous Graph Transformer**”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01332)  for more details.

This implementation of HGT is based on [Deep Graph Library (DGL)](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) API, following their [tutorial](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.4.x/tutorials/hetero/1_basics.html)

TODO: Current DGL example use random input node feature. We'll later add other benchmark using meaningful input node features.
